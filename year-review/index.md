# My 2020 In Review: Staying Strong


## Introduction
Hey everyone! I’m excited to share with you my year end review for 2020.

<!--more-->

2020 has been about staying strong mentally! 😃

I’m glad to say that whilst 2020 might have been a tough year, I was able to achieve things I am proud of 💪.

I’m excited at what 2021 is going to bring.


Philippians 4:8:
-  In conclusion, my friends, fill your minds with those things that are good and that deserve praise: things that are true, noble, right, pure, lovely, and honourable.



## Personal Development
- **[Jolt Switch](https://london.jolt.io/switch-uk)** - August - September 2020

What an amazing course!

I enjoyed every bit of it, made new friends, improved the quality of my network and started on the path to becoming a CTO.

### Some feedback from my fellow soji's that made me happy

  _"Very cleaver, can solve every computer problem and clearly a deep thinker"_

  _"Thanks for sharing all your knowledge in class & on slack!"_

  _"Edi - I'll definitely miss, we've had a great time and a few laughs in the break out rooms."_
